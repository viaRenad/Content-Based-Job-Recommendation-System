# Content-Based-Job-Recommendation-System
A job recommendation system that matches users to opportunities based on their skills. It uses two approaches — TF-IDF vectorization and word embeddings — to understand and compare job descriptions with user profiles. The system focuses on semantic similarity rather than simple keyword matching, providing smarter, more relevant suggestions.
